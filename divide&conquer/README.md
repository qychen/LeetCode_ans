# DIVIDE & CONQUER

The purpose of D&C is decrease the number of counting! So like in pow(x,n), it doesâ€™t matter that it actually does same number of 2*2, but it decrease the number of multiply by new = old*old(*..), where the number becomes half of before, since the latter old does not need to be count again!
